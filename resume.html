                Described by a former manager as a Swiss army knife, I have have several talents and expertise! My biggest
                assest is my curiosity and determination to figure things out. This website is one example. While I'm currently
                in the job market, I decided to use my free time to learn HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. So this website was built
                completely from scratch without a template, by me.
